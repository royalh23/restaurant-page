This project creates a simple Restaurant page layout using webpack. The webpage has 3 parts:
home, menu, and contact. Various front-end skills have been practiced in this project, such as:

- Webpack bundles different code files and assets into a main.js file to achieve better optimization;
- ES6 modules have been utilized to achieve more organized code;
- Various packages have been installed and implemented using npm;
- All DOM elements are created dynamically using JavaScript thanks to webpack.
